# AI NFT

This is a very good project for combination of AI and blockchain and these are some tools that I use in this project for example I use solidity and hardhat and nft storage for getting API for saving the nfts on ipfs and hugging face that is a AI image generator that we can use that API in our project. This project is the combination of AI and blockchain and how it is work? when we click on a generate, request will be sent to AI and backed from there and we can send it in a blockchain and save in there. this is how smart contract works and how AI image generator works.
